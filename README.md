## Problem Statement
FACECOM Hackathon Project: A robust face recognition and gender classification system designed to perform consistently across challenging environments like blur, fog, low-light, and overexposure. Leverages the FACECOM dataset to bridge the gap between ideal and real-world conditions. Built with Python, PyTorch and TensorFlow, this model tackles face recognition and gender classification under visual degradations (blur, fog, etc.) using FACECOM dataset.

## Solution Approach
### Task_A: [Gender Classification]
- Architecture: [e.g., "Custom CNN with EfficientNet backbone"]
- Key Features: [List 2-3 special techniques used]

### Task_B: [Face Recognition]
- Architecture: 
- Key Features:
